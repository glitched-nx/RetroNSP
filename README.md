I am brand new to this so there may be problems. Please feel free to give suggestions, fixes, automation, add games, etc. These downloads rarely go smoothly so please feel free to post your problems and I will get to you ASAP. This is a community and system that I love and would like to give back to.  
Please propose project names too.    : )  
I have no idea if the nsp files will work without the prod keys I used to make them. Someone please test and let me know.
